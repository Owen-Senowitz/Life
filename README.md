# Life
This program is written in C++. This program has a couple parameters. There are a bunch of different files you can test this program on.
If an occupied cell has 0 or 1 neighbors, it dies of loneliness.
If an occupied cell has 4 or more neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.
If an empty cell has exactly 3 occupied neighbor cells, there is a birth of a new cell to replace the empty cell.
A cell (occupied or empty) which has exactly 2 neighbors is stable - no death or birth.
